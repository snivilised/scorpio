## üî∞ Introduction

This project will be used as an additional test aid of the currency features of [___lorax___](https://github.com/snivilised/lorax) outside of the scope the unit tests that it already contains.

## üìö Usage

### Worker Pool Pipeline

From user provided flags, the __pool__ command submits a stream of jobs to the worker pool for concurrent execution. The job is defined as a function which takes a name and emits a greeting to this recipient. Since this function does not represent real work and therefore takes next to no time to run, it is infused with a synthetic delay to simulate real work. The delay is currently defined as a random interval.

- ‚ñ∂Ô∏è __Producer(jobsChSize, stopAfter) => jobsCh:__ generates a workload

üìå Variables:

| Name       | Flag    | Unit    | Description |
|------------|---------|---------|-------------|
| jobsChSize | _jobq_  |         | Capacity of the jobs channel |
| stopAfter  | _after_ | seconds | Stops the producer after this time period |

- ‚ñ∂Ô∏è __Pool(noOfWorkers, jobsCh) => resultsCh:__ handles the workload with multiple workers generating a result stream

üìå Variables:

| Name          | Flag    | Unit    | Description |
|---------------|---------|---------|-------------|
| noOfWorkers   | _now_   |         | No of workers in pool |

- ‚ñ∂Ô∏è __Consumer(resultsChSize, resultsCh):__ consumes the result stream

üìå Variables:

| Name          | Flag    | Unit    | Description |
|---------------|---------|---------|-------------|
| resultsChSize | _resq_  |         | Capacity of the results channel |

___‚ö° Invocation:___

```
scorpio pool --after 3 --now 5 --jobq 18 --resq 16
```

### ‚òëÔ∏è Code coverage

- `coveralls.io`: add scorpio project

### üåê l10n Translations

This template has been setup to support localisation. The default language is `en-GB` with support for `en-US`. There is a translation file for `en-US` defined as __i18n/deploy/scorpio.active.en-US.json__. This is the initial translation for `en-US` that should be deployed with the app.

Make sure that the go-i18n package has been installed so that it can be invoked as cli, see [go-i18n](https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n) for installation instructions.

To maintain localisation of the application, the user must take care to implement all steps to ensure translate-ability of all user facing messages. Whenever there is a need to add/change user facing messages including error messages, to maintain this state, the user must:

- define template struct (__xxxTemplData__) in __i18n/messages.go__ and corresponding __Message()__ method. All messages are defined here in the same location, simplifying the message extraction process as all extractable strings occur at the same place. Please see [go-i18n](https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n) for all translation/pluralisation options and other regional sensitive content.

For more detailed workflow instructions relating to i18n, please see [i18n README](./resources/doc/i18n-README.md)

### üß™ Quick Test

To check the app is working (as opposed to running the unit tests), build and deploy:

> task tbd

(which performs a test, build then deploy)

NB: the `deploy` task has been set up for windows by default, but can be changed at will.

Check that the executable and the US language file __scorpio.active.en-US.json__ have both been deployed. Then invoke the __pool__ command with something like

> scorpio pool -now 5 --job 18 --resq 16
